# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App] 
In this sample code, we first define two states users and isLoading using the useState hook. We then define a function fetchUsers that makes an API call to get the user data and updates the users state with the fetched data. We also set the isLoading state to true while the API fetches the data and set it back to false when the data is fetched
